# MPJ Unit Testing Series

My notes from the [MPJ](https://github.com/mpj) Unit Testing [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu35xM76kKY&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr) Series.

## Enviroment Setup

As MPJ, I'm using Visual Code with [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) Extension. It's pretty awesome. Check it out!

Once installed, reload to use and ```Ctrl``` + ```k```, ```q``` to start in the current file and ```Ctrl``` + ```k```, ```e``` to stop it.
